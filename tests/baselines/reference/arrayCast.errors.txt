tests/cases/compiler/arrayCast.ts(3,23): error TS2352: Conversion of type '{ foo: string; }[]' to type '{ id: number; }[]' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type '{ foo: string; }' is not comparable to type '{ id: number; }'.
    Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'foo' does not exist in type '{ id: number; }'.
