    // This test is asserting that a single property/element access
    // on `this` is a special assignment declaration, but chaining
    // off that does not create additional declarations. Iâ€™m not sure
    // if it needs to be that way in JavaScript; the test simply
    // ensures no accidental changes were introduced while allowing
    // element access assignments to create declarations.
