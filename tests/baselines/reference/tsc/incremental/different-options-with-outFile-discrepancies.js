2:: with declaration should not emit anything
Clean build tsbuildinfo will have compilerOptions with composite and declaration
Incremental build will detect that it doesnt need to rebuild so tsbuild info is from before which has option composite only
*** Supplied discrepancy explanation but didnt file any difference
4:: with declaration and declarationMap
*** Needs explanation
File: /src/outfile.d.ts
CleanBuild:
declare module "a" {
    export const a = 10;
}
declare module "b" {
    export const b = 10;
}
declare module "c" {
    export const c = 10;

6:: with emitDeclarationOnly should not emit anything
Clean build tsbuildinfo will have compilerOptions with composite and emitDeclarationOnly
Incremental build will detect that it doesnt need to rebuild so tsbuild info is from before which has option composite only
Clean build info does not have js section because its fresh build
Incremental build info has js section from old build
