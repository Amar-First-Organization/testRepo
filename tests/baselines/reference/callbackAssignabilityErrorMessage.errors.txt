callbackAssignabilityErrorMessage.ts(31,1): error TS2322: Type 'Source1' is not assignable to type 'Target'.
  Types of property 'map' are incompatible.
    Types of parameters 'callbackfn' and 'callbackfn' are incompatible.
      Type 'T | undefined' is not assignable to type 'T'.
        'T' could be instantiated with an arbitrary type which could be unrelated to 'T | undefined'.

    // During the following assignment, `Source1["map"]` gets
    // instantiated with the contextual type `Target["map"]` before checking
    // assignability. To do that, an inference is made to `S`. For `Source1`,
    // the only candidate is `T | undefined` from the return type of `callbackfn`.
    // Inference also runs on `map` return types `S[]` and `T[]`, but the result
    // is discarded because it’s run with a lower inference priority. As a result,
    // we end up seeing if the contextually instantiated source signature:
    //
    //   (callbackfn: (value: string) => T | undefined) => (T | undefined)[]
    //
    // is assignable to the target signature:
    //
    //   (callbackfn: (value: string) => T | undefined) => T[]
    //
    // and the return types cause the failed assignability. But as a human reader
    // interpreting why `s1` is not assignable to `t`, I instead equate `S` and `T`
    // and identify the “real” problem as the return type of `callbackfn` in `Target`
    // (`T | undefined`) being a supertype of the one in `Source1` (`S` → `T`).
    
    t = s1; // Bad:  instantiates `S` with `T | undefined`, fails `map` return type assignability
