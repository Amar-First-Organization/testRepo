tests/cases/conformance/types/typeRelationships/comparable/optionalProperties02.ts(6,1): error TS2352: Conversion of type '{ a: undefined; }' to type 'Foo' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Property 'b' is missing in type '{ a: undefined; }' but required in type 'Foo'.
