tests/cases/compiler/typeParametersShouldNotBeEqual.ts(5,5): error TS2322: Type 'Object' is not assignable to type 'T'.
  'Object' is assignable to the constraint of type 'T', but 'T' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint '{}'.
    The 'Object' type is assignable to very few other types. Did you mean to use the 'any' type instead?
