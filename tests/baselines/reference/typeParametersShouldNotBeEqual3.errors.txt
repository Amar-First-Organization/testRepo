tests/cases/compiler/typeParametersShouldNotBeEqual3.ts(4,5): error TS2322: Type 'U' is not assignable to type 'T'.
  'U' is assignable to the constraint of type 'T', but 'T' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint 'Object'.
    Type 'Object' is not assignable to type 'T'.
      'Object' is assignable to the constraint of type 'T', but 'T' could be instantiated with a different subtype of constraint 'Object'.
        The 'Object' type is assignable to very few other types. Did you mean to use the 'any' type instead?
